# BetterChessTrainer
Compares your move to a stockfish and a Grandmaster's using Lichess' API. Once played, bot responds based on a real online game (Lichess API again). Personal side project to crush my brother and the dorm floor.

Currently working version in OpeningTrainer.py in desperate need of refactoring.
