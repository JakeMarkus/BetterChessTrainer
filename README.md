# BetterChessTrainer
Compares your move to a stockfish and a Grandmaster's using Lichess' API. Once played, bot responds based on a real online game (Lichess API again). Personal side project to crush my brother and the dorm floor.

Currently working version in OpeningTrainer.py is in desperate need of refactoring. Nothing more permanent than a temporary solution!
